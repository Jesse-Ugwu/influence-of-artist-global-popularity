# Influence of Artist Global Popularity

This project explores the global popularity of artists using data analysis and visualization in Python.

##  Key Objectives
- Investigate key metrics influencing artist popularity across countries
- Use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for analysis
- Generate insights for music industry stakeholders

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (Kaggle)
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Correlation analysis and plotting

##  Key Findings
- A few countries (like the United States, United Kingdom and Canada) have the highest number of artists and also tend to have higher   	GDPs, suggesting economic power may influence artist visibility or resources.
- Most countries have a higher number of solo artists than bands, especially developed ones Countries like the US and UK. 
  Solo artists are more dominant globally.
- Some highly populated countries (e.g., India) have fewer globally ranked artists but the US and UK has more ranked artist and population
